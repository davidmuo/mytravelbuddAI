Travel Planner AI is a dynamic web application designed to assist users in planning their trips effortlessly. By entering a city name, users can access real-time weather data, AI-generated event suggestions, travel tips, and beautiful city images. This project leverages multiple APIs and was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To run this application locally, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project folder. Install a simple web server such as http-server. You can do this globally by running npm install -g http-server. Once installed, start the server by running http-server in the project directory. This will host the application at a local address (e.g., http://localhost:8080). Open the link in your browser to interact with the application.

To deploy the application to the provided web servers, connect to the servers using SSH or an SFTP client. Upload the project files to the /var/www/html directory on the server. To secure the application, install SSL certificates using Certbot and configure Nginx for HTTPS. Test the deployment by accessing the server’s public IP through a web browser. Restart Nginx to ensure all changes take effect. The application will be live and accessible to users.

This application uses three primary APIs. The WeatherAPI provides real-time weather data and can be explored further at https://www.weatherapi.com/. The Unsplash API supplies high-quality city images and is documented at https://unsplash.com/developers. Finally, Google's Gemini API is used for generating travel tips and event suggestions, and its documentation is available at https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai. These APIs were crucial in enhancing the application's features and functionality.

During development, some challenges were encountered and resolved. Integrating multiple APIs concurrently while maintaining smooth performance required careful handling of asynchronous operations. This was addressed by utilizing JavaScript’s Promise.all to fetch data simultaneously, reducing delays. Styling the application for responsiveness across various devices was another hurdle. This was achieved by testing and adjusting CSS media queries and layouts extensively. Debugging API responses and ensuring clean formatting of AI-generated content required additional logic to sanitize and process the data efficiently.

Acknowledgments are due to the developers of the APIs used in this project. Their robust and reliable APIs made it possible to build an engaging and feature-rich application. Special thanks also go to libraries and tools like Node.js, http-server, and Nginx, which supported local development and deployment.
